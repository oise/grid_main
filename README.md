# Grid UI task

###

**Objective**: Build a UI for a Dynamic Data Grid Editor that interacts with the provided GraphQL backend to manage a
set of **Data Grids**, including adding, updating and managing rows and columns. The goal is to demonstrate your skills
in frontend development, focusing on UI/UX, React, and efficient GraphQL integration.

### Problem Statement:

You are tasked with building an interface for a **Data Grid Management System**. The system consists of multiple grids,
each containing dynamically generated rows and columns. Your UI should allow users to:

1. **Create and Select Data Grids**:
    - Display a list of all available grids.
    - Allow the creation of new grids.
    - Enable switching between different grids.
2. **Manage Rows and Columns in Each Grid**:
    - Users can add new rows to a grid. Each row should have a unique title (e.g., `Row Title 1`, `Product A`).
    - Users can add new columns to a grid. Each column should have a unique title (e.g., `Column Title 1`,
      `Description`, `Price`).
    - Users can edit the titles of existing columns or rows in-place.
3. **Display Cells**:
    - Each cell is created and filled automatically by the API whenever a new row or column are added. A cell lives at
      the intersection of a row and a column.
    - Cells contain two fields:
        - `content`: The main value of the cell.
        - `comment`: An additional notes field.
    - If time permits, make cells editable to update the `content` and `comment` directly in the UI.
4. **Real-Time Updates**:
    - Ensure that the UI reflects any changes made to the grid, such as when rows or columns are added or edited.
    - Optionally, Use GraphQL subscriptions to handle these real-time updates.

### Provided Backend:

We have set up a GraphQL backend using Hasura with the following schema:

- **DataGrid**: Represents a grid.
    - `id` (UUID): Unique identifier for the grid.
    - `name` (String): Name of the grid.
- **Row**: Represents a row in a specific grid.
    - `id` (UUID): Unique identifier for the row.
    - `grid_id` (UUID): Reference to the `DataGrid`.
    - `title` (String): Title of the row.
- **GridColumn**: Represents a column in a specific grid.
    - `id` (UUID): Unique identifier for the column.
    - `grid_id` (UUID): Reference to the `DataGrid`.
    - `title` (String): Title of the column.
- **Cell**: Represents a cell in the grid at the intersection of a row and a column.
    - `id` (UUID): Unique identifier for the cell.
    - `grid_id` (UUID): Reference to the `DataGrid`.
    - `row_id` (UUID): Reference to the `Row`.
    - `column_id` (UUID): Reference to the `GridColumn`.
    - `content` (String): Main content of the cell.
    - `comment` (String): Optional comment or description.

### GraphQL API Operations:

You can use the following operations, Feel free to use any other operations needed for improving the UX:

1. **Queries**:
    - Fetch the list of grids.
    - Fetch the rows and columns of a selected grid.
    - Fetch cells for a given grid, row, or column.
2. **Mutations**:
    - Add a new grid.
    - Add a new row.
    - Add a new column.
    - Update cell values (`content` and `comment`) if implementing the bonus cell editing feature.
3. **Subscriptions**:
    - Subscribe to changes in the grid, including new rows, columns, or cell updates.

### Task Requirements:

1. **Frontend**:
    - Use **React** and **TypeScript**.
    - Use **GraphQL** for data fetching (using any GraphQL client like `urql` or `Apollo`).
    - Feel free to use **TailwindCSS** for styling.
    - Optionally, Implement state management using **React Context**, **Redux**, or any other suitable state library.
2. **UI Functionality**:
    - Implement a UI that allows the creation of new grids and dynamically manages the addition of rows and columns.
    - Build a data table that displays rows and columns for the selected grid.
    - Make the table cells editable, with a clear visual distinction for `content` and `comment` fields (if implementing
      the bonus).
3. **Real-Time Updates**:
    - Use GraphQL subscriptions to handle real-time updates whenever rows, columns, or cells are added or modified.

### **Important Notes**:

- **Cutting corners** is perfectly fine! This task is designed to assess **how you approach problems** and **build
  solutions** rather than focusing on perfect implementation.
- **Prioritize the core functionality** (grid creation, adding rows and columns) first. If you have extra time, move on
  to the bonus features.
- Use any library or tools that you are comfortable with for building the frontend.

### Bonus Points:

- Implementing the **cell editing** functionality for updating `content` and `comment` fields.
- Using **React Remix** for routing and data loading.
- Implementing additional features like **drag-and-drop** reordering of columns and rows.
- Adding **inline validation** for cell values.
- Building a well-structured and reusable component architecture.
- Making the design **responsive** for both desktop and mobile views.

### Evaluation Criteria:

- **Code Quality**: Clean, well-tested code with clear separation of concerns.
- **UI/UX**: User-friendly and visually appealing interface.
- **Functionality**: Full implementation of the required features.
- **Use of GraphQL**: Efficient querying, mutation, and subscription usage.
- **Time Management**: Please donâ€™t spend longer than 4 hours on this task. Prioritize the core features first and hand
  in whatever you managed to complete within this time period..
